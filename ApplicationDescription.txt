A little java application for the visualization of the algorithm for dividing a (regular) polygon
into y-monotone ones by adding diagonals. It illustrates the algorithm of the book
Computational Geometry by de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld and Overmars, chapter 3.

You can either load an example polygon or draw your own polygon for the algorithm.
Then it will go along the sweep line events through the vertices of the polygon. 
Thereby every line of the code for every vertex is handled solely.

The application is the outcome of a little students project in the lecture
'Algorithmische Geometrie' at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics
 of the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT) in summer semester 2014.
