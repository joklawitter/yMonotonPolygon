A little java application for the visualization of the algorithm for dividing a (regular) polygon
into y-monotone ones by adding diagonals. It illustrates the algorithm of the book
Computational Geometry by de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld and Overmars, chapter 3.

So given a simple polygon, i.e. the edges do not intersect each other and we have just one border,
we search for the y-monotone subpolygons. This means that functions for the left
and the right border of the subpolygons are injectiv for the y-coordiante.
The subpolygons get computet by adding diagonals when merge or split vertices occur.

You can either load an example polygon or draw your own polygon for the algorithm.
Press play and it will go along the sweep line events through the vertices of the polygon. 
Thereby every line of the code for every vertex is handled solely.

The application is the outcome of a little students project in the lecture
'Algorithmische Geometrie' at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics
 of the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT) in summer semester 2014.
