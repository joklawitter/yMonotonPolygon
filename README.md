yMonotonePolygon
===============
A little students project for the lecture 'Algorithmische Geomtrie' at the KIT in 2014.
The aim of this project is to visualize the algorithm for dividing a (regular) polygon
into y-monotone ones by adding diagonals.

The illustrated algorithm is based on the one explained in chapter 3 
of the book Computational Geometry by de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld and Overmars.
